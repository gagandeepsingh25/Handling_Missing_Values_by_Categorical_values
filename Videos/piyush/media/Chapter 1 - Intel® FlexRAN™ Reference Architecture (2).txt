00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.267
Hello and welcome to the Intel Telco
Cloud Academy.

00:00:06.167 --> 00:00:10.133
This lesson is on virtualized
Radio Access Network software,

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:13.167
or vRAN software.

00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:14.400
In this lesson,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.133
we will cover some of the
important software concepts

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.233
that Intel delivers
to the vRAN ecosystem

00:00:20.267 --> 00:00:23.067
through the
FlexRAN Reference Architecture.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.867
First, we will learn about
the FlexRANâ„¢ Reference Architecture,

00:00:26.867 --> 00:00:30.400
what it is
and what it is not.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.200
Then, we'll discuss how the
FlexRAN Reference Architecture

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:37.900
fits into the wider
vRAN software ecosystem

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.533
and talk about some use cases,
plus the software development kit.

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:47.267
After that, we'll deep dive
into the FlexRAN software

00:00:47.267 --> 00:00:49.333
and the BBU pooling architecture,

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.600
which is a software architecture

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.233
employed to deliver baseband
pooling and CPU core scaling.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:01.067
The final section will cover Cloud
Native RAN building blocks

00:01:01.067 --> 00:01:04.967
such as the Linux OS,
containers, and DPDK,

00:01:05.033 --> 00:01:07.033
which are fundamental in order

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.767
to achieve the high performance

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:13.100
and low latency required
for 5G networks.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.600
After viewing this course,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.667
the learner should be able

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:19.800
to identify the Intel software
wireless technologies

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.167
that enable vRAN

00:01:21.167 --> 00:01:22.467
and how they are delivered

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:24.800
in the
FlexRAN Reference Architecture.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.600
Also, you should
be able to illustrate

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.667
the benefits of vRAN software
wireless technologies,

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:33.933
and examine how FlexRANâ„¢ software

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:36.433
integrates with third-party software

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:39.800
to enable commercial
vRAN implementations.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.233
This section will provide

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:45.667
an overview of the
FlexRAN Reference Architecture.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's get started.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.067
FlexRAN Reference Architecture
is a software

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.500
and hardware Reference Architecture

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.100
to enable the software RAN ecosystem

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.700
to build and deploy
highly-optimized, feature-rich

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:04.267
4G and 5G scalable
Cloud Native vRAN implementations

00:02:04.267 --> 00:02:07.633
on Intel architecture.

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:09.733
The FlexRANâ„¢ Reference Architecture

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.767
supports an entire portfolio

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.500
of 4G and 5G pre-integrated software
and hardware stacks

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.533
running virtualized
Distributed Units or vDUs.

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:22.800
The FlexRAN Reference Architecture

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.533
can also be used
to implement

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:28.833
virtualized Centralized Unit,
or vCU, software.

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:32.667
From a single software code base,
the Intel FlexRAN software

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:35.967
can be scaled to support
narrow band, mid band,

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:38.867
Ultra-Reliable
Low Latency Communications,

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:42.700
and even millimeter
wave configurations.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.433
As the software architecture
is flexible,

00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:49.667
the user can determine the best
configuration for their use case

00:02:49.667 --> 00:02:54.067
and even mix and match
4G and 5G in the same BBU pool

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:58.733
for Decision Support System
or DSS support.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.867
FlexRAN Reference Architecture

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:02.400
builds on a foundation

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.367
of a common,
scalable hardware platform

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.833
using Intel silicon and innovation.

00:03:08.867 --> 00:03:11.467
This includes Intel Xeon CPUs,

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:16.000
structured Application Specific
Integrated Circuit, or eASIC,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.600
accelerators for
Forward Error Correction,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.867
and ethernet products for low latency
fronthaul connectivity.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.667
As a software implementation,

00:03:25.667 --> 00:03:28.133
the FlexRAN Reference Architecture

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:31.700
is fully flexible
and scalable across multiple

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.833
use cases and hardware platforms.

00:03:34.833 --> 00:03:37.833
This allows the solution
to scale from Small Cell

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:42.233
with Intel Xeon D processors
up to macro and C-RAN

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:45.333
with Intel Xeon Scalable processors,

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:48.533
all with the same
scalable software solution,

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:50.733
delivering on the
disaggregated hardware

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:54.967
and software promise
of virtualized RAN.

00:03:55.067 --> 00:03:58.833
The Intel Select Solutions for
Virtual Radio Access Network

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:02.233
offer operators
a streamlined path to deployment

00:04:02.233 --> 00:04:05.067
with validated stacks of
hardware and software

00:04:05.067 --> 00:04:08.467
built in conjunction
with other industry leaders

00:04:08.467 --> 00:04:11.867
for flexible performance
and rock-solid security.

00:04:12.167 --> 00:04:16.067

at the end of this course.

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:22.567
The FlexRAN Reference
Architecture

00:04:22.567 --> 00:04:25.133
is designed to be flexible,

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:28.933
giving developers access to a set
of optimized libraries

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:31.933
for 4G and 5G workload acceleration

00:04:31.933 --> 00:04:35.833
in the form
of the Software Development Kits.

00:04:35.867 --> 00:04:39.267
The Software Development Kits
are packaged modularly

00:04:39.267 --> 00:04:40.967
so that they can be used

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:45.200
as part of the overall solution
or taken independently.

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:50.033
They provide the building blocks
to create the DU reference stack.

00:04:50.067 --> 00:04:52.933
FlexRAN software
integrates seamlessly

00:04:52.933 --> 00:04:54.533
with the
Cloud Native RAN building blocks

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:56.867
for scalable, automated deployment,

00:04:56.867 --> 00:04:59.633
supporting multiple operating systems

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:03.267
and Containers-as-a-Service,
or CaaS, providers.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.033
A software-based
RAN implementation can scale quickly

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:10.733
and easily
through many different deployments.

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.300
Now that we've seen an overview

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.667
of the
FlexRANâ„¢ Reference Architecture,

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.433

to learn more about

00:05:18.433 --> 00:05:21.767
